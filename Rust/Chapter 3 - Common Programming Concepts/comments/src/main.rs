// Hello world as a comment

// So we’re doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
// multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
// explain what’s going on.

//  The blow comment style is also valid in Rust
/*
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
*/

fn fn main() {
    // Another valid comment style puts comments
    // before the function you're typing to annotate.
    let lucky_number = 7; // I'm feeling lucky today
}
