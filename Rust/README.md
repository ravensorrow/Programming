2024/01/24: Ch4.2: Referances and Borrowing - After a brief hiatus, I have 
    resumed my self-led education. December had me busy with life and the 
    holidays. Then I got sick between Christmas and New Years, missed a week of 
    work for it too. Been eyeballing my resumption of this endeaver since the 
    new year and then I got sick again a week ago. Just new recovering from 
    that (this one resulted in a trip to the E.R.). Hopefully, I can find that 
    base I once had and stay on top of this again. I really would like to 
    finish it and I've even made some side notes on some project idea's to work 
    on in the future.
